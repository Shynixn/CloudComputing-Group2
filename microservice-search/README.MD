### Microservice-Search

##### Setting up using Kind

Delete cluster if already running
```console
kind delete cluster
```

Create cluster and mocked docker registry called localhost:5000 (Use Git Bash on Windows)

```console
./kind-local-registry.sh
```

Apply namespace for the ``search-environment``

```console
kubectl apply -f namespace.yaml
```

Install the ElasticCloudKubernetes (See: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/cloud-on-k8s/master/k8s-deploy-eck.html
)

```console
kubectl apply -f https://download.elastic.co/downloads/eck/1.3.0/all-in-one.yaml
```

Apply the ElasticSearchCloudCluster settings for the ``search-environment``


```console
kubectl apply -f elasticsearch.yaml
```

Build the C# WebApi 

```console
cd webapi/BookStoreSearch
docker build -f BookStoreSearch/Dockerfile -t localhost:5000/search-webapi:1.4 .
```

Push the created C# WebApi Docker image into the mocked docker registry called localhost:5000  

```console
docker push localhost:5000/search-webapi:1.4
```

Go back to the folder microservice-search

```console
cd .. 
cd ..
```

Apply the webapi settings for the ``search-environment``

```console
kubectl apply -f webapi.yaml
```

Check if everything is working
```console
kubectl get all --namespace search-environment
```

```console

##### Accessing the WebApi

Eventually, this service works like that:

Port forwarding for testing

```console
kubectl port-forward service/search-webapi 8080:80 --namespace search-environment
```

Adding mock content

```console
POST http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/books
{
  "Name" : "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone",
  "Description" : "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone is a fantasy novel written by British author J. K. Rowling.

  "Author" : "J. K. Rowling"
}
```

```console

{
  "Name" : "The Last Wish",
  "Description" : "The Last Wish (Polish: Ostatnie Å¼yczenie) is the first (in its fictional chronology; published second in original Polish) of the two collections of short stories (the other being Sword of Destiny) preceding the main Witcher Saga, written by Polish fantasy writer Andrzej Sapkowski.",

Sending search requests

```console
GET http://127.0.0.1:8080/api/search?query=Witcher
```

```console
