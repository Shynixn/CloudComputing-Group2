# Bookstore

Our goal is to implement a bookstore with different microservices.

The different subystems are:
* Search (author, title, description, genre, ISBN) - results: books, book list
* Selection of books (detailed description of book)
* Shopping cart (order), shopping cart view
* JavaScript frontend, which builds up the JSON response
* Database with books (read only), database for shopping cart (editable)
